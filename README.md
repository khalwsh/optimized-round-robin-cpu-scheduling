# optimized-round-robin-cpu-scheduling
this is an optimize for the scheduling algorithm which is know as round-robin here rather than make the proccess order as fifo then applying the qunatum slice we do an arragment of process based on averaging time using dynmaic programming and building the path
to get the optimal order after that we make ternary search for finding the optimal slice so that we can farther more optimize the round robin algorithm
